# build with MSBuild
build:
  project: StateMachine.sln             # path to Visual Studio solution or project
  parallel: true                        # enable MSBuild parallel builds
  verbosity: normal                     # MSBuild verbosity level {quiet|minimal|normal|detailed}


# Sadly we cannot use the standard "dimensions" based approach towards
# specifying the different builds, as there is no way to add one-offs
# builds afterwards. This means that we will painfully specify each
# build explicitly.
